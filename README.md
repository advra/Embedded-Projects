These are STM32 MicroController files created within an Eclipse environment.
These files use the STM32F4/0 Discovery (CortexM4/M0 family) and utilize the GNU
ARM Toolkit Chain. 

There are two hello world blinky codes:
hello-f0 is for the stm32f0 discovery
hello-f4 is for the stm32f4 discovery

The other files show the progression development using th STM32F4 in my current
project as follows:

s1-barebones	-	Core boiler-like template showing register setup
s2-driver		-	Writting my first Driver (for now has only header files but will come with 
					the class files when I get around to it)
